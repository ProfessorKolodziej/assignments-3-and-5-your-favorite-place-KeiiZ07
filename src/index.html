		  <li>The painting in the picture named <b>“Bathers at Asnières” </b> by Georges Seurat.  The use of color in this painting makes me feel comfortable. The people resting by the river are in sharp contrast with the factory in the distance that is constantly emitting smoke due to production.</li>

		 <ul style="padding-left:0px">
		   <li><b>21</b> Paintings in this room</li>
		   <li>This room are involved with both landscape paintings and portraits.</li>
		   <li>Paintings by <b>John Constable, Thomas Gainsborough, Joseph Mallord William Turner</b> and so on.</li>
		   <li>While Stubbs was the only artist to depict <b>heroic racehorses </b>in a clearly British way, Gainsborough and Reynolds' portraits of British society by <b>the late eighteenth century</b> adopted a large European size. In their family and group portraits, Derby artists Hogarth and Wright stuck to the conventional themes of mortality. More people in France than in England appreciated Constable's avant-garde approach to landscape painting, which emphasized the fleeting nature of light and weather.</li>

		   <li>Paintings by <b>Canaletto, Francesco Guardi, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo</b> and so on.</li>

		   <li>Venice, while no longer a maritime powerhouse, still thrived in trade and art until the late 18th century. Canaletto and Guardi excelled in portraying Venetian views, with Guardi emphasizing light and city activity. Tiepolo's vibrant art sparked a renaissance, influencing Pittoni, who played a key role in the international success of Venetian Rococo.</li>

The portrait highlights her as a patron of arts and fashion, embodying bourgeois virtues. Interestingly, the artwork is composed of <b>two canvases</b>, with a smaller one featuring her head and shoulders seamlessly integrated into the larger full-length depiction.</li>
