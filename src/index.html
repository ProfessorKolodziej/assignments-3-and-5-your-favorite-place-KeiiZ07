		  <li>The painting in the picture named “Bathers at Asnières” by Georges Seurat.  The use of color in this painting makes me feel comfortable. The people resting by the river are in sharp contrast with the factory in the distance that is constantly emitting smoke due to production.</li>
		  <li>You can also find other paintings with big name such as “Sunflowers”, “Two Crabs”, “Van Gogh’s Chair” and “Motherhood”.</li>

		   <li>21 Paintings in this room</li>
		   <li>This room are involved with both landscape paintings and portraits.</li>
		   <li>Paintings by John Constable, Thomas Gainsborough, Joseph Mallord William Turner and so on.</li>
		   <li>While Stubbs was the only artist to depict heroic racehorses in a clearly British way, Gainsborough and Reynolds' portraits of British society by the late eighteenth century adopted a large European size. In their family and group portraits, Derby artists Hogarth and Wright stuck to the conventional themes of mortality. More people in France than in England appreciated Constable's avant-garde approach to landscape painting, which emphasized the fleeting nature of light and weather.</li>

		   <li>Venice, while no longer a maritime powerhouse, still thrived in trade and art until the late 18th century. Canaletto and Guardi excelled in portraying Venetian views, with Guardi emphasizing light and city activity. Tiepolo's vibrant art sparked a renaissance, influencing Pittoni, who played a key role in the international success of Venetian Rococo.</li>

		   <li>The painting below is a naturalistic portrait of Madame de Pompadour, Louis XV's former mistress, is a departure from formal court art.
